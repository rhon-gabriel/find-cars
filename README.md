# Find you perfect car

This is a simple web app which allows user to find the perfect car based on the manufacturer and model they select. 
Found cars will display informations about the manufacturer, model, fuel type, body type and engine capacity. 
It is mobile and desktop-friendly.

### How to start the app

Terminal 1
1. run "npm install"
2. run "npm start" and it should open http://localhost:3000

Terminal 2
1. run "node apiserver/server.js"

### Test

The app, using react testing library, tests:
- App is rendered correctl
- Vehicles are listed inside cards and if no vehicle is found, it will display a message to the user
- Dropdown list and disabled

### Tech stack

- React
- Redux
- Redux-Saga
- CSS module
- Axios

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
